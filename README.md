### Description
This project is intended to be the operational back end of a simple e-commerce website. It's purpose is to moke the online management of an e-commerce store more manageable for the user solving the problem of a disorganized online presence and the loss of revenue that would result. I learned that I still need to work on creating proper routes as that was the main challenge I faced as portrayed in the video below.

### Installation
The interface for this project is a CLI, so all you would need for install is the proper files and the equavilent of a terminal with node installed.
